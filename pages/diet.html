      <h3>Things Your Body Needs as You Age</h3>
      <h4>Vitamins that help you age well</h4>
      <p>
		Calcium: 
		With age, you can start to lose more of this mineral than you absorb. That can make your bones break more easily (osteoporosis), 
		especially for women after menopause. Calcium helps your muscles, nerves, cells, and blood vessels work right. You get most of it from your bones, 
		which get it from food. Women over 50 and men over 70 should get about 20% more than other adults. Milk, yogurt, and cheese are good sources.
	  
	  Vitamin B12: 
		It helps make blood and nerve cells. You get it naturally from animal foods like meat, fish, eggs, and dairy. Pills, shots, and “B12-fortified” foods, 
		like breakfast cereal, are other sources. Most Americans eat enough, but age can change that. Up to 30% of people over 50 have atrophic gastritis, which makes 
		it harder for your body to absorb it from foods. Antacids, some meds, and weight loss surgery can contribute to a lack of B12.

    <h3>The Definitive Guide to Healthy Eating in Your 50s and 60s</h3>
    <h4>The role nutrition plays in aging well</h4>
    <p>
	By the time you reach your 50s, you should pay even closer attention to what you put in your body. By maintaining a balanced eating pattern that emphasizes key nutrients, you can improve your odds of healthy aging to continue living a dynamic, active lifestyle.

	This article provides an in-depth guide to healthy eating in your 50s and 60s.
	While aging is inevitable and normal, you can take steps to encourage healthy aging. The main goal of this effort is to extend the number of healthy, active years you have. In many cases, you can live a very active lifestyle well into your late adulthood.

	Numerous factors affect healthy aging, such as:

	diet,
	physical activity,
	health conditions and medical history (including heart disease, type 2 diabetes, cancer, and mental decline),
	genetics,
	social support,
	smoking and substance use,
	access to quality medical care,
	In particular, nutrition plays a major role in healthy aging by reducing one’s risk of chronic disease, age-related muscle loss (sarcopenia), weakened bones (such as in osteoporosis), malnutrition, and underweight or overweight status.

      <h3>7-Day Mediterranean Diet Meal Plan for Healthy Aging, Created by a Dietitian</h3>
      <h4>Supporting longevity has never been so delicious</h4>
      <p>
		As we age, we lose muscle and bone mineral density, and our risk of chronic disease increases. But there are many ways to help slow down the progression of aging, especially through healthy diet and exercise. One way is by 
		following the Mediterranean diet. The principles of the Mediterranean diet focus on eating more whole foods, like fruits, vegetables, nuts and whole grains, while eating fewer highly processed foods and less red meat, saturated
		fat and added sugar. It’s intentionally flexible and focuses on food groups rather than specific foods so it can be easily customized. Research shows that adhering to the Mediterranean diet can help keep you agile and feeling good—both 
		physically and mentally—for longer.   

		The Mediterranean diet focuses on foods that are high in antioxidants, substances that scour your body’s cells and help rid them of free radicals, which are molecules that can harm your body over time.
