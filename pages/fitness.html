    <h4>Stay healthy by starting yoga</h4>
    <p>Thirty-eight years ago, cardiologist Dean Ornish, M.D., made headlines with his claim that yoga and meditation, when combined with improvements in diet and exercise habits, could reverse heart disease.

Since then, research into the health benefits of yoga, especially its effect on adults 50-plus, has exploded.

      <p>Water Aerobics: Exercising in water is a great way to move your body if you’re worried about arthritis and joint pain. The water helps support your body weight, and it also provides a natural resistance, eliminating the need to use additional weights.

	Some exercises to consider in water aerobics are leg lifts, arm circles, and walking in place.
	Chair Yoga

	Yoga has been scientifically proven to not only have therapeutic effects but to also improve the quality of life of those who practice it.

	Given inaccurate assumptions about yoga, however, many people think that they are not capable of doing yoga, especially older adults. While some yoga poses do seem daunting — such as a handstand scorpion pose —many are safe, easy, and beneficial.
