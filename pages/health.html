      <h3>Milestone Medical Tests in Your 50s</h3>
      <h4>Preventative care</h4>
      <p>You're in your 50s. It's the prime of your life -- or it should be. Don't let illness rob you of your health.

		When you go for your annual physical, make sure your doctor performs or recommends these simple tests that may save your health -- and your life -- later. (Note that your doctor may recommend other tests based on your personal health profile.)

		Colon cancer screening is recommended for everyone at age 45. Colon cancer is the second-leading cause of cancer deaths in the U.S. When you turn 45, your chance of getting it goes up. Colonoscopy is the test most frequently recommended, though there are other options. Ask your doctor which screening test is best for you.

		Stepping on the scales. This is the age when most people start gaining weight. Watch this weight gain carefully, and fight back with healthier eating and exercise. Being overweight puts you at high risk for getting a number of diseases -- and studies show that weight loss can improve your odds.

    <h3>What's Normal Aging?</h3>
    <h4>A guide to healthy aging</h4>
    <p>
	As you get older, your blood vessels and arteries become stiffer. Your heart has to work harder to pump blood. This can lead to high blood pressure and other heart problems.

Try this: Stay active. Walk, run, swim -- even a little moderate exercise each day can help you stay at a good weight and keep your blood pressure down.

Eat lots of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains to keep your heart healthy.  Manage stress. Get enough sleep. 7 to 8 hours of rest each night can help repair and heal your heart and blood vessels.

Your Skin Feels Different
You might notice that your skin feels drier and less supple than it once did. That’s because your skin makes less natural oil as you age.

Also, you sweat less, and you lose some of the fatty tissue just below the skin. This can make it seem thinner.

You may also notice wrinkles, age spots, and skin tags, or tiny growths of skin.

Try this: Hot water dries skin out, so take warm baths and showers.

      <h3>Sleep and Aging</h3>
      <h4>How sleep changes as we age</h4>
      <p>
	  Is your sleep different than it used to be when you were younger? It happens to a lot of people.

	Nearly half of men and women over the age of 65 say they have at least one sleep problem. With age, many people get insomnia or have other sleep disorders.

	It’s true that as we get older, our sleep patterns change. In general, older people sleep less, wake up and go back to sleep more often, and spend less time in deep sleep or dreaming than younger people.

	But at any age, you still need quality rest to be healthy.

	What Causes Sleep Problems With Age?
	Some common reasons include:

	Poor sleep habits: If you don’t keep a steady schedule for going to bed and waking up, it can affect your body’s internal clock and make it even harder to get good sleep.
